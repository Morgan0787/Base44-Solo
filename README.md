# UniMatch

![UniMatch — matching engine overview](assets/readme/hero.svg)

Find universities you can actually get into — not just the ones you dream about. UniMatch compares a student's GPA, IELTS, or TOPIK score against real admission requirements across Europe, the US, and Asia, and ranks results by honest admission chance instead of popularity.

## Why it's different

Most university-search sites are directories: browse, filter, hope. UniMatch inverts that — every listed university carries a transparent match percentage computed from the same numbers admissions officers actually look at (GPA, language scores, acceptance rate), so a student sees realistic reach/target/safety options instead of a wall of logos.

## How it works

- **Frontend** — Vite + React + Tailwind, component library via shadcn/ui
- **Backend** — Supabase (Postgres + Auth), migrated off the original Base44 platform
- **Core pages** — `Search`, `Recommendations`, `Profile`, `Login`, plus internal tools (`AdminDataQuality`, `AdminFeedback`, `EssayChecker`)

## Data quality

University records (GPA/IELTS thresholds, deadlines, tuition, scholarships) are collected from official admissions pages rather than generated. Each record is expected to carry a `source_url` and a `verified` flag so the app — and the built-in `AdminDataQuality` tool — can distinguish confirmed data from fields still awaiting verification.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Required env vars

- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

### Optional env vars

- `VITE_LOGIN_URL` (custom login route)
- `VITE_LLM_FUNCTION_NAME` (default: `invoke-llm`)
- `VITE_TABLE_UNIVERSITY` (default: `universities`)
- `VITE_TABLE_STUDENT_PROFILE` (default: `student_profiles`)
- `VITE_TABLE_USER_FEEDBACK` (default: `user_feedback`)

## Status

Actively developed, pre-launch solo project. Expect incomplete data coverage and rough edges outside the core search/match flow.
