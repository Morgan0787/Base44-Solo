# UniMatch — Project Context

Paste or attach this file at the start of any new AI chat (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini) to skip re-explaining the project from scratch.

## What it is
UniMatch matches Central Asian (primarily Uzbek) students to universities in Europe, US, and Asia based on GPA/IELTS/TOPIK, ranked by realistic admission chance rather than popularity. Built by a solo developer as both a portfolio piece (Babson College application) and a potential business.

## Stack
- Frontend: Vite + React + Tailwind, shadcn/ui
- Backend: Supabase (Postgres + Auth), migrated off Base44
- Auth: Supabase Auth with Google OAuth + email, working as of last check
- Deploy: Vercel

## Database state (Supabase project: UniMatch4.0)
- `universities` table exists, schema matches frontend code exactly (see Known Gotchas below)
- ~1944 US universities imported via College Scorecard API (official govt data, no GPA/IELTS — those fields intentionally null for US records)
- ~24 South Korean universities imported via Gemini-assisted research batches (verified/source_url tracked)
- ~918 universities across Europe/Asia still NOT imported (batched into 39 CSV files of 25 each, original list sourced from a prior partner's Base44 database that turned out to be mostly synthetic/fabricated data — only name/country/city/website from that source were trustworthy, everything else was regenerated)
- `student_profiles` and `user_feedback` tables created, RLS enabled

## Known gotchas (don't rediscover these)
- Column `"topikLevel"` (camelCase, quoted, TEXT type, values like `"TOPIK 4"`) — NOT `topik_level` snake_case integer. Code in 7 files expects this exact format.
- `user_feedback` sorts by literal column `created_date`, not `created_at`.
- `tuition_currency_note` is NOT a real column in this Supabase project — don't include it when preparing CSVs.
- Korean-university tuition figures often come in KRW (millions) not USD — check magnitude before import.

## Product decisions made
- **Auth gating**: Profile and Recommendations require login (redirect to /Login). Search and Home stay open to everyone.
- **Missing GPA/IELTS/TOPIK**: shown via `EstimatedField` component — a region-based ballpark range labeled "estimate", never fed into the actual chance-matching calculation. Never invent a specific number for a specific university.
- **Missing tuition/acceptance_rate/degree_levels/notable_programs**: no synthetic estimate exists for these (too much variance between schools) — show "Not published" instead.
- **Data sourcing principle**: never accept LLM-generated numbers as fact without a `source_url` and explicit `verified` flag. This whole pipeline exists because a prior partner's data (GPA/IELTS/scholarships) turned out to be AI-fabricated and nearly shipped as real.
- Do not scrape/reuse data from competitor sites (e.g. Studyportals) — database-rights and ToS risk, plus it undermines the actual differentiator (accuracy).

## Open TODOs
- 37 of 39 Gemini-research batches still need processing + import
- `codex/fix-lint-errors-minimally` branch on GitHub is stale/superseded — don't merge without review
- `npm run lint:fix` would clean ~19 unused-import warnings
- User acquisition plan (IELTS/tutoring centers, Telegram channels, personal SAT-prep network) designed but not yet executed — this is the actual current bottleneck, not more infrastructure

## Working agreements
- Prefer official/government data sources over LLM web-research where they exist (e.g. College Scorecard for US) — more accurate, no rate limits, no hallucination risk.
- When an AI can't verify a fact, it should say so explicitly (empty field / "not verified"), not fill in a plausible-sounding number.
- Long chat threads get expensive to keep running — start a fresh chat per major task phase, using this file to re-establish context.



## Bug fixed 2026-07-26
apiClient.js normalizeUniversity() was coercing null min_gpa/tuition_min to 0 via asNumber(x, 0) fallback.
This made ALL 1944 US universities show "GPA 0.0" and null-tuition ones show "Free" incorrectly.
Fix: use asNullableNumber() for min_gpa, tuition_min, tuition_max instead — preserves null so
EstimatedField/"Not published" fallback logic works as designed.

## Known data gap (not a bug)
All 1944 US university rows (College Scorecard import) have NULL campus_life, international_support,
visa_info, min_gpa, degree_levels. Cards look "empty" because there's genuinely no data — this is
expected per the "never invent data" rule, not something to fix in code. Real fix = data enrichment
(same Gemini-research process used for the 24 Korean universities), applied to US rows too, or
prioritize importing the 918 pending Europe/Asia records which have richer data.


## Fixed 2026-07-26
- apiClient.js: min_gpa/tuition_min/tuition_max now use asNullableNumber (were falling back to 0, causing fake "Free" tuition and fake "0.0 GPA" on all US universities)
- UniversityCard.jsx + UniversityDetailModal.jsx: tuition now shows min–max range when both values exist
- Root data gap unchanged: all 1944 US rows still lack campus_life/visa_info/international_support/min_gpa — cards will keep showing "Not published" there until real data is imported (see earlier gap note)


## Added 2026-07-26 — generic US fallback content
New file src/lib/usGenericInfo.js: US_GENERIC_VISA_INFO, US_GPA_HOLISTIC_NOTE, US_GENERIC_SUPPORT_NOTE.
These are federal-law/well-documented general facts (F-1 visa rules, holistic admissions norm),
NOT fabricated per-university data. Wired into UniversityCard.jsx and UniversityDetailModal.jsx:
- min_gpa null + country=="United States" → show "Holistic admissions" note instead of blank/estimate
- visa_info null + country=="United States" → show generic F-1 visa card, clearly labeled
  "General info — not specific to this university"
Per-university verified data always overrides these when present.

## Next up
Point-enrich top 200 US universities (by popularity/affordability) via Gemini research batches,
same process used for the 24 Korean universities — real min_gpa, campus_life, notable_programs,
international_support per school. Free tier Gemini, manual batches of ~25.
